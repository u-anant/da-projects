# <p align="center">INSTAGRAM USER ANALYTICS</p>

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

* Objective of this project is to gain insights and improve engagement, reach, and performance on Instagram.
* The areas of analysis include loyal users, post reminders, popular users, top hashtags, peak registration days, and fake accounts.
* User engagement is also analyzed using the metrics such as average number of images and number of users and photos on the platform.
* These insights will be used for informed decisions to improve engagement and performance.

## APPROACH

The project was completed in several steps. First, I understood the tasks and identified the necessary data sources and tools for analysis. Next, I prepared by installing and updating the required technology stack and connecting to the database. In the processing stage, I understood the structure of data and broke down the tasks into elementary operations. Next, I understood the metrics associated with each task. I then used SQL and Python to perform the analysis in the action stage. Finally, I shared the analysis report by creating a PDF document and linking to the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.

## INSIGHTS

* The oldest users have been using Instagram since 2016 indicating that the platform has been actively running for 6+ years.
* 26 % of the users have never posted a single photo, which is significant and indicates a lack of engagement.
* The most liked image on Instagram has been liked by 48 % of the users, which is a huge number and should be taken up as a case study.
* Hashtags are one of the major factors in increasing the reach of the posts and must be chosen wisely.
* Knowing the day of the week when most users register on Instagram can help in scheduling an AD campaign to target the largest possible audience.
* On average, users make between 2 and 3 posts, which is a low number. There is a need to take steps to increase the number of posts made by users.
* Bots can be identified by their actions, which differ from those of a human account.
* 13% of the accounts have been identified as bots, which is a significant percentage. Therefore, it is imperative to implement strict verification measures to ensure human users.

## RESULT

* Gained hands-on experience with SQL and Python, working with large datasets and retrieving specific information using SQL queries.
* Developed analytical and problem-solving skills by solving real-world marketing and investor problems.
* Gained insights into marketing strategies and social media analytics, which could be useful for future marketing campaigns.
* Developed critical thinking skills by finding creative solutions to complex problems, and gained proficiency in working with databases and data manipulation techniques, which are valuable in various industries and fields.
